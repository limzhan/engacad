            <h2>Project : Github Website</h2>
            <p>This was the first project that I took on once I entered the Engineering Academy. The purpose of this site 
              is to be a place where I can easily document other projects that I take on from anywhere and archived on the 
              internet.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Since we were building a webstite, the languages we used were HTML and CSS. I also decided to use Visual Studio Code 
              as I had some familiarity with it. 
            </p>

            <p>
              After the text of the document is written, CSS is used to give formatting and/or colour to the webpage. Animations can 
              also be used to bring more "pop" to the website. This can be easily done by using online resources. In this case, I used
              <a href="https://animate.style/" target="_blank">https://animate.style/</a>. The website had detailed steps that was easy to follow, making the 
              process of implementing said animations very easy.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Lastly, we had to host the website. Github was recommended because of its reputauion and ease to use. The cost of hosting a website
              was also free as long as it was made public.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <img src="githubinterface.png" height="500">
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Above shown is the interface on Github after logging into an account and creating a test repository. Adding a file can easily be done 
              by clicking the Add File tab and just dragging the file into the upload box. After that, publishing the website is next. After that, we have 
              a link and thus, the site is done.
